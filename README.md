Do-it-yourself CA IDMS JDBC Driver Wrapper for OSGi.

The goal of this feature is to make the standard CA IDMS JDBC driver, as it is
delivered by CA Technologies, available in OSGi environments (like Eclipse).

Please refer to http://sites.google.com/site/idmsschemasineclipse/ and to my
blog (http://kozzeluc.wordpress.com) for more information.

The CA IDMS JDBC driver is owned by CA Technologies and is NOT delivered with
this do-it-yourself plug-in package; users have to copy the driver AND build the
update site themselves.
